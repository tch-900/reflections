When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I'm collaborating with other people who also need access to the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I'd want to keep control over what I have locally. It could be confusing if a file I'm working on changes while I'm still working on it
